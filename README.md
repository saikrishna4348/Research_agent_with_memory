```markdown
# 🧠 Academic Research Agent with Memory

> An offline, local-first Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for academic literature search, enhanced with persistent memory and local LLM inference.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Semantic Search** over academic PDFs using FAISS
- 📄 **PDF Parsing** with OCR support (Tesseract)
- 🧠 **HuggingFace LLM Integration** (Runs locally, no API keys)
- 💾 **Persistent Embedding Indexing** with FAISS
- 🧠 **Memory-Enhanced Retrieval Pipeline**
- 🏗️ **Modular Codebase** – Easily extend or replace components

## 🛠️ Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saikrishna4348/Research_agent_with_memory.git
cd Research_agent_with_memory
```

### 2. Create & Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv RAG
# On Windows
RAG\Scripts\activate
# On Unix/Mac
source RAG/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📥 Download and Save Local LLM

Use this script to download your preferred local Hugging Face model (e.g. `google/flan-t5-base`):

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM
import os

model_name = "google/flan-t5-base"
save_path = "local_models/flan-t5-base"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

tokenizer.save_pretrained(save_path)
model.save_pretrained(save_path)
```

---

## 💬 Run the Agent

```bash
python main.py
```

You'll be prompted to ask queries, and the system will:
- Retrieve relevant chunks from PDFs
- Generate LLM responses based on those chunks

---

## 🤖 LLM Response Example

```
🔍 Query: What are aneurysms?

📚 Retrieved Docs:
- Aneurysms are localized dilations of blood vessels that...

🧠 LLM Response:
An aneurysm is a balloon-like bulge in an artery caused by a weakening of the artery wall. It can lead to serious health complications if ruptured.
```

## 📌 Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- FAISS
- LangChain
- HuggingFace Transformers
- SentenceTransformers
- Unstructured (for PDF parsing)
- Tesseract (for OCR)
